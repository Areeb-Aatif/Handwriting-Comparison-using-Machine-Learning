# Handwriting-Comparison-using-Machine-Learning

We used linear regression, logistic regression and neural networks to develop predictive models to detect the writer of handwritten documents. Later we tune our model to get better accuracy.

For feature extraction we used two datasets. One is human observed dataset and the other is GSC dataset.
